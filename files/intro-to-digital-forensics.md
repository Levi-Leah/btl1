# Introduction to Digital Forensics

* the process of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence, sometimes so that it can be submitted as evidence in court
* **Digital Forensics Process**
  * recognized scientific and forensic process used in digital forensics investigations
    * mainly referring to activities conducted by law enforcement
  * **Identification**
    * identify sources of relevant evidence or information (devices), key custodians, and location of data
  * **Preservation**
    * preserve relevant electronically stored information (ESI)
      * protect the crime scene, capture visual images of the scene, and document all relevant information about the evidence and how it was acquired
  * **Collection**
    * collect digital information that may be relevant to the investigation
      * remove the electronic devices from the crime scene and then image, copy or print out its content
